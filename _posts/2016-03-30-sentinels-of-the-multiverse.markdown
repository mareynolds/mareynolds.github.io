Sentinels of the Multiverse is a cooperative card game for 1-5 players where a team of superheroes work together to defeat a single powerful supervillain. How does it fare? It's awesome! I've played it 20+ times and win or lose, it is an enjoyable and engaging experience. The artwork is a throwback to an earlier time and really adds to the spirit of the game. The decks are different enough that each player will feel like they are contributing to the team and the alpha-dog effect is virtually eliminated from the game. The contents of the game are solid; the box of the base game itself is 1/3 empty, allowing for future expansions. I liked this game so much I acquired the Rook City, Infernal Relics, and Shattered Timelines expansions, all of which just barely fit in a single box. There are dividers provided with artwork that is good enough that it is tempting to pull them out on the table next to your deck of hero cards just because it is that awesome. Who wouldn't like this game? It comes with a pack of tokens with 1, 5, 10, and 25's, which can be used to either keep track of the heroes and villain's health or damage. The maintenance of these damage tokens can be cumbersome; personally it doesn't bother me (I'm an accountant by trade so working with numbers is second nature to me), but some people have expressed that the constant math (such as who has the highest/least health at any given moment) can be a task to track. Fortunately there are a few third-party apps out there that are designed to track the health of each player in a centralized fashion, eliminating the need for health tokens. I prefer to use the tokens so each person is fully aware of their hero's health and doesn't have to ask the person running the app what their health is. Further, isn't a reason for tabletop games to take some time away from the screentime that takes up so much of our lives? Anyway, it is totally up to each individual player.
Enter the villains of the multiverse! The base game includes many more heroes than villains, though subsequent expansions usually include 4 new villains and 2 new heroes. The villains are ranked in difficulty so it would be wise for the new player to start with the easier villains to get the hang of the game before confronting the more difficult ones. After you've conquered the difficult villains there is an "advanced mode" that make each villain even harder! The endless combinations of heroes, villains, and environments provide substantial replay value for the game, and on the Greater Than Games website there are downloadable <a href="https://greaterthangames.com/system/files/downloads/Villain%20Challenge%20Mode.pdf">villain challenges</a> and <a href="https://greaterthangames.com/system/files/downloads/Hero%20Challenge%20Achievements.pdf">hero challenges</a>. 

TLDR;
Sentinels of the Multiverse is a well constructed game that really brings a group of teammates together so that you really feel like a team of unique superheroes! It is an easy to learn, fun, team-building experience that works for the non-gamer and gamer alike.
