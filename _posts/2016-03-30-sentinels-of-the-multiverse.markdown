Sentinels of the Multiverse is a cooperative card game for 1-5 players where a team of superheroes work together to defeat a single powerful supervillian. How does it fare? It's awesome! I've played it 20+ times and win or lose, it is an enjoyable and engaging experience. The artwork is a throwback to an earlier time and really adds to the spirit of the game. The decks are different enough that each player will feel like they are contributing to the team and the alpha-dog effect is virtually eliminated from the game. 

TLDR
Sentinels of the Multiverse is a well constructed game that really brings a group of teammates together so that you really feel like a superhero! It is an easy to learn, fun, team-building experience that works for the non-gamer and gamer alike.
